        <p>Books are vastly common and yet I am rarely exposed to people reading solely for their entertainment and curiosity. This has been the case for me as well, as I have been struggling to adapt to the beauty and the enjoyment of books for a particularly long time.</p>

        <p>Reading books is highly underrated. Books are vital as they present new information, stories and the general idea of the world in which people should present themselves to.</p>
